## Create custom configuration field with Magento 2

Stores &gt; Configuration:

Create the file :

`app/code/Test/Jobs/etc/adminhtml/system.xml`

- "tab" node create a new tab. Attribute "sortOrder" allow to change position on the list.

- "section" node add a new element to our tab.

- "group" node create a group of field on the form.

- "field" set the "select" type, and define the label and the comment. - "source\_model" allow to retrieve the array of values for the select. We use a native object from Magento which return a "Yes/No" array.



> You can add some section / group / field in Magento native tabs / sections / groups. For example, you can add a new group with some new field inside the "Catalog" tab and "Catalog" section.

## Manage config scope

The attributes : showInDefault, showInWebsite, showInStore

Magento will retrieve the config value like this :

- If the field has got store view scope \(showInStore\), and a value is defined, we return it

- Else if the field has got website scope \(showInWebsite\), and a value is defined, we return it

- Else we return the default scope value \(showInDefault\)

&gt; Itâ€™s an example of the configuration creation. You can change it if you want, and have fields only with the store view scope !

## ACL creation

File :

`app/code/Test/Jobs/etc/acl.xml`
