# Magento architecture principles

## OOP architecture and programming principles {#m2arch-oop-architecture}

**Class**

A class is a template for an object, a user-defined datatype that contains variables, properties, and methods. You should imagine any class as a wrapper of functions \(methods\) that will help you manipulate some specific data.

**Method**

An expression for a function bound to a class.

**Instance**

Instance is an object \(datatype\) created by your class.

**Inheritance**

Inheritance is a process in which a class inherits all the state and behavior of another class \(extend, implement\)

**Abstraction**

Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations. It reduces and factors out details so that one can focus on a few concepts at a time.

**Singleton**

Singleton restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.

## Strongly layered product architecture {#m2arch-layered-product-architecture}

Magento tweaks the classic Model-View-Controller architectural model, though: files within modules are typically grouped by functionality rather than file type.

The _Magento Framework_ defines the fundamental concepts and rules for how the components of the web site can behave.

## Integration with architectural layers {#integration-with-architectural-layers}

### Presentation layer {#presentation-layer}

View components \(layouts, blocks, templates\) and controllers.

Include web API service bindings.

### Service layer {#service-layer}

Defines the overall interface for interacting with business logic. Service contracts simplify the process of replacing or modifying \(via plugins\) services.

### Domain layer {#domain-layer}

Referred to as the Business Logic layer, provides business logic and functionality in base classes, resource models, and data access capabilities that you can extend and customize.

## Ease of extensibility {#m2arch-extensibility}

Use dependency injection and service contracts to simplify the process of supplying a new implementation of a defined API.

## Modularity {#m2arch-modularity}

Extend the core feature set of Magento by writing and incorporating new modules into your installation. Use Magento themes and language packages to create your store’s visual design and language capabilities.

## Highly customizable store branding {#m2arch-store-branding}

Extend and customize the core components of your Magento store’s PHP-, HTML5- and CSS3- based default themes and language packages to precisely control your site’s behavior and look-and-feel.

## Strong stack of open-source technologies {#m2arch-open-source-stack}

Includes popular open-source technologies such as the Linux OS, Apache/Nginx server, MySQL, Zend, and Composer.

# Architectural basics overview

### Extensibility and modularity

Designed from its earliest stages for customization and enhancement.

#### Architectural principles that guide product structure

Replacing or extending core code rather than editing.

#### Open-source software to create and manage extensions

Uses Composer to manage dependencies.

#### Coding standards

Zend Framework Coding Standards for PHP

[http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/coding-standards/bk-coding-standards.html](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0/coding-standards/bk-coding-standards.html)

#### Upgrade and versioning strategies

Well-defined upgrade and versioning strategies that can help you avoid any problems with software component dependencies.

# Ease of frontend customization

Designed to optimize storefront customization, with highly extensible themes being the central customization mechanism.

## Storefront customization tools {#storefront-customization-tools}

#### Magento Blank Theme

#### Magento UI Library Components

* enforce for consistency in design across your storefronts

* simplify \(and speed up\) the design process

#### Magento Admin Pattern Library

User interface \(UI\) design patterns

* address form
* button bar
* container
* tabs
* sign-in form

Built on the LESS preprocessor and implemented as a module.

# Global features that support extensibility

### Modularity {#modularity}

This loose coupling of software components reduces the ripple effects throughout your code base of changing code.

### Reliance on popular design patterns {#reliance-on-popular-design-patterns}

Model-View-Controller \(MVC\)

### Coding standards {#coding-standards}

Based on Zend Framework Coding Standards.

### Rich product ecosystem {#rich-product-ecosystem}

Many modules and themes available for download and to buy modules and theme packages.

### Flexible attribute types {#flexible-attribute-types}

Enhance your storefront by adding unique attributes to the default product attributes.

Attribute types fall into three general categories:

* **EAV \(Entity-Attribute-Value\) attributes** are site-specific attributes that you can define for a local site using the Magento Admin.

* **Custom attributes** are a subset of EAV attributes. Objects that use EAV attributes typically store values in several MySQL tables. The Customer and Catalog modules use EAV attributes.

* **Extension attributes** often use more complex data types than custom attributes. These attributes do not appear in the storefront. Extension attributes are introduced by modules.

### Web APIs {#web-apis}

Web API \(REST or SOAP\) with some simple XML.

* CRM \(Customer Relationship Management\)
* ERP \(Enterprise Resource Planning\) back office systems
* CMS \(Content Management Systems\).

### Service contracts, dependency injection, and dependency inversion {#service-contracts-dependency-injection-and-dependency-inversion}

Service contracts provide a new way to access public API endpoints.

Magento implements dependency injection along with service contracts \(ease-of-extensibility, support the loose coupling\).

### Plug-ins {#plug-ins}

Mechanism for adding features to the core Magento product.

Make changes to the behavior of any public method in a Magento class.

Interceptors.

Applications use the plug-in pattern to change method behavior without modifying the actual class. Plug-ins can typically intercept method processing before or after the method runs, or only when the method throws an exception.

# Security

## Enhanced password management {#enhanced-password-management}

Hashing algorithms \(SHA-256\)

## Improved prevention of cross-site scripting \(XSS\) attacks by making escaped data the default {#improved-prevention-of-cross-site-scripting-xss-attacks-by-making-escaped-data-the-default}

Adopted conventions that regulate the escaping of data in output.

Escape output for HTML pages \(HTML, JSON, and JavaScript\) and email.

## More flexible file system ownership and permissions {#more-flexible-file-system-ownership-and-permissions}

Using a [umask](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/understanding-linux-unix-umask-value-usage.html).

## Improved prevention of clickjacking exploits {#improved-prevention-of-clickjacking-exploits}

Using an X-Frame-Options HTTP request header \([X-Frame-Options header](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/config-guide/secy/secy-xframe.html)\).

## Use of non-default Magento Admin URL {#use-of-non-default-magento-admin-url}

Default creates a random Admin URI when you install the product. The CLI is provided so that you can see the password if you forget it.

Prevent large-scale automated attacks.

# Storefront customization strategies

## Storefront customization levels {#storefront-customization-levels}

### Extend Magento-Provided CSS {#extend-magento-provided-css}

Default theme has a LESS-based CSS =&gt; change a storefront using CSS only.

### Replace PHTML template files {#replace-phtml-template-files}

Generate different HTML markup.

### Replace Magento-Provided CSS {#replace-magento-provided-css}

Allows use of different CSS tools or technologies not provided with Magento.

### Replace Magento-Provided CSS, HTML, and JavaScript {#replace-magento-provided-css-html-and-javascript}

### Automated testing {#automated-testing}

Provides automated testing suites that include unit, integration, functional and performance test scripts, as well as JavaScript tests and tools for static code analysis.

Components include PHPUnit for the unit test framework and Selenium for the functional test framework.

# Backward compatibility

Magento 2.0 uses Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 to indicate whether a change breaks backward compatibility.

* _MAJOR_ indicates incompatible API changes

* _MINOR_ indicates backward-compatible functionality has been added

* _PATCH_ indicates backward-compatible bug fixes

The backward compatibility policy applies to PHP code annotated with `@api.`

# Versioning policy

Magento software versioning complies with the following specifications:

* [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)

* [Versioning specification of Composer system](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#version)

* [PHP version\_compare\(\)](http://php.net/version_compare)

## Version formats {#version-formats}

The pre-release version format is: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-&lt;alpha \| beta \| rc&gt;n, where alpha, beta or rc are stability indications, as described in the version\_compare\(\) specification, and n is an increment number to distinguish releases of the non-stable versions.

## Public APIs {#public-apis}

This designation indicates the code can be used or customized by other components, such as formal interfaces and dependency injection points.

## Where versioning is used {#where-versioning-is-used}

Magento component or bundle, inside the `composer.json` file.

It can be declared as the version of the component:

```
"name":"acme/foo",
"version":1.2.0
```

Or it can be used to declare a dependency on a particular version of a component:

```
"require":{
"acme/foo":"1.2.*",
"acme/bar":"2.2.0"
}
```

## Release types {#release-types}

This section describes how exactly and when the software version numbers will be changed with releases.

### Development releases {#development-releases}

Magento may update the `x.y.z` version in way perscribed by Semantic Versioning, but also could release the same `x.y.z` with different stability and/or index numbers.

### Stable releases {#stable-releases}

In every stable release, the same value of version number will be propagated in all components, but dependencies will have a wildcard \(\*\) pattern.

The `x.y.z` numbers will change according to Semantic Versioning policy provisions. For example, `1.0.0 -> 1.0.1 -> 1.1.0 -> 1.5.0 -> 1.5.1 -> 2.0.0 -> 2.1.0`.

# Architectural layers overview

## Magento as layered software {#magento-as-layered-software}

Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture

## Advantages of layered application design {#advantages-of-layered-application-design}

Magento will appreciate:

* Stringent separation of business logic from presentation logic simplifies the customization process. For example, you can alter your storefront appearance without affecting any of the backend business logic.

* Clear organization of code predictably points extension developers to code location.

# Presentation Layer

## What is Magento Presentation layer? {#what-is-magento-presentation-layer}

Interact with the Magento web interface =&gt; directly working with _presentation layer_ code.

The presentation layer contains both view elements \(layouts, blocks, templates\) and controllers.

Three types of Magento:

* **Web users** interact with the store front, where they can see the View model of data displayed by Magento and interact with product UI elements to request data for view and manipulation. These users work within the \(`frontend`\) area.

* **System administrators** customizing a storefront can indirectly manipulate the presentation layer by, for example, adding themes or widgets to the front end.

* **Web API calls** can be made through HTTP just like browser requests, and can be made via AJAX calls from the user interface.

## Presentation layer components {#presentation-layer-components}

Each theme resides in a unique directory and contains custom page layouts, templates, skins, and language files.

## View model {#view-model}

* **Blocks** can generate dynamic content and can contain named child view elements that are similar to arguments being passed in. \(The `as` attribute holds the child view element names for the parent block to reference them\)

* **Containers** collect an ordered group of children view elements.

Blocks can generate their content using static HTML, Knockout JS scripts, and PHTML.

## How Presentation code calls other layers {#how-presentation-code-calls-other-layers}

Presentation code typically calls service contracts.

## Presentation layer flow {#presentation-layer-flow}

Presentation layer components make calls to the Service layer, which in turn sends requests to the Domain \(or business logic\) layer.
