## OOP architecture and programming principles {#m2arch-oop-architecture}

**Class**

A class is a template for an object, a user-defined datatype that contains variables, properties, and methods. You should imagine any class as a wrapper of functions \(methods\) that will help you manipulate some specific data

**Method**

An expression for a function bound to a class

**Instance**

Instance is an object \(datatype\) created by your class

**Inheritance**

Inheritance is a process in which a class inherits all the state and behavior of another class \(extend, implement\)

**Abstraction**

Abstraction refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations. It reduces and factors out details so that one can focus on a few concepts at a time.

**Singleton**
